- userName (string, required)
- content (string, required)
- type (string, required, default: "text")
- timestamp (datetime, required)

Permissions:
- Read: users
- Create: users
```

**3. Code Sessions Collection**
```
Collection ID: code_sessions
Attributes:
- workspaceId (string, required)
- userId (string, required)
- userName (string, required)
- language (string, required)
- title (string, required)
- code (string, required, size: 1000000)
- cursorPositions (json)
- selections (json)
- createdAt (datetime, required)
- lastModified (datetime, required)

Permissions:
- Read: users
- Create: users
- Update: users
- Delete: users
```

### 3. Environment Configuration

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Update `.env` with your Appwrite credentials:
```env
VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_NAME=V-yes-code
VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=your-database-id
VITE_APPWRITE_WORKSPACES_COLLECTION_ID=workspaces
VITE_APPWRITE_MESSAGES_COLLECTION_ID=messages
VITE_APPWRITE_CODE_SESSIONS_COLLECTION_ID=code_sessions
```

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`
